The aim of this guide is to provide ways of getting around the forced mechanisms Pokemon Go pushes in its game. </p>

Your behavioural data that Pokemon Go wants is now messed with.</p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

                    <p>Pokemon GO makes money through continuously tracking and identifying players radius within a commercial area. This is used by businesses who pay for Sponsored Pokestops and in-game incentives are used to manipulate your behaviour. </p>
