            <p>INTRODUCTION</p>
            <h2>What is Pokemon Go? <br> What is this guide about?</h2>
            <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
            <p>Pokemon Go is marketed as a fun game to catch Pokemon while improving your health and to exercise more. However, behind closed doors, players are taken advantage of through game mechanisms controlled by Niantic. Pokemon Go is an example of gamification of exercise (Tonkinwise, 2023), and measures foot traffic through location tracking. <br><br>Players are also unknowingly doing free labour through playing the game and following the set path that the game controls players to do. Niantic takes players data, measures behaviour and databases location statistics to sell to third party companies who take advantage of all the data purchased from Niantic. This all lends itself to the issue of surveillance capitalism and the research question, “How are we being monitored and encouraged to change our behaviour in Pokemon Go for the sake of capitalism?”.<br><br>
                This is a helpful guide for the players to play differently from what Pokemon Go expects from you. The aim of this guide is to provide ways of getting around the forced mechanisms Pokemon Go pushes in its game that were created to collect more data. According to my research where I interviewed current Pokemon Go players, the level of awareness of how these gameplay mechanics are used for surveillance capitalism is not in depth. Players also don’t realise how they are providing free labour which is an important concern to discuss so this guide will also inform players of these dangers and how to not be compliant.</p>

            <p>HOW IS POKEMON GO EXPLOITING FREE LABOUR FROM PLAYERS?</p>
            <h2>Gameplay Mechanisms</h2>
            <div class="text-box">


                <p>

                    There are many gameplay mechanisms within Pokemon Go that exploit the players for data and are examples of surveillance capitalism. The main way to play begins by turning your location and camera on to start catching Pokemon. Players are nagged to turn on adventure sync which lets Pokemon Go run in the background collecting your location and understand how much you have walked.
                    <br><br>
                    The algorithm in which Pokemon Go encourages users to exercise more is with incentives such as walking more to hatch eggs and gain a Pokemon. Another mechanism is the Pokestops that are placed all around the world with players going to Pokestops to spin it. Pokestops provide many items such as Pokeballs that help players continue to catch more Pokemon. AR mapping is becoming more prevalent in Pokemon Go as they keep nagging players to scan the Pokestop with their camera and use manipulative tactics by rewarding the player with a rare item.<br><br>
                    There are two systems of gameplay that aim to change players behaviours to play every day by building habits and using incentives. The first one is a buddy system in Pokemon Go where you can choose a Pokemon and raise friendship levels by looking after it every day. The other is the friend system which works by having players gift each other to raise their friendship levels. Raising friendship levels unlocks new rewards and give an advantage to both users. These are the gameplay mechanics that influence players behaviours and shows how Pokemon Go uses Behavior Steering Design (Tonkinwise, 2023).

        <div class="content">
            <h2>All about Data</h2>
            <img src="images/Factors.png">

            <p>The dangers of encouraging players to develop behaviours of addiction through in-game incentives under the guise of exercising is increasing smartphone addiction and providing free labour. With cases of severe addiction and wanting to catch them all, Niantic is given more location data with AR mapping than ever before. The sharing of the location means Niantic is able to precisely identify a player’s real time location and track their behaviour. They can track what food franchise you consistently purchase from or how you navigate a shopping centre (Zhu, 2016). 
                <br><br>
                Pokestops have an AR mapping mechanism that nags players to scan an area at a Pokestop with their camera. The system tracks when you are close to the Pokestop and will provide a quest for you to scan that area or monument. Players are rewarded with a rare item for scanning a Pokestop and this is all part of the free labour players provide. When feeding your buddy, there is a forced action to use the camera to feed your Pokemon which is known as a default dark pattern as there is no other option to turn your camera off (Brignull, 2023).
                <br><br>
                A concern with the friend system, is that people can figure out where you live when you send gifts based on locations you've been to. They can also see a lot of your information through usernames and the avatar you’ve created to look like you. This could lead to dangerous situations with one extreme case having lured players to an inconspicuous place and robbing them. Pokemon Go developers have failed to consider the edge case (Tonkinwise, 2023), when developing this game and this is evident in the number of accidents that occurred while playing Pokemon Go and being preoccupied with their smartphones.

            <h2>The Implications</h2>
            <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>



            <p>‘The terms of service of the game refute legal responsibility of the developers in case of injury, damage to property, or related mishaps while playing the game.’ (Mukhra, 2019). Pokemon Go encourages players to be preoccupied on their smartphone collecting Pokemon and aren't responsible for any legal consequences when players get themselves in dangerous situations.
                <br><br>All Pokemon Go is concerned with is gathering data from users and exploiting the nostalgia that players have with the Pokemon Franchise. By monetising and constantly making tasks grindy, players are even more preoccupied playing Pokemon Go to catch up with all the gameplay mechanics. Surveillance capitalism is seen as Niantic tracks the distance players have walked, calories burned and store large number of timestamped locations (Royce, B. 2019). Thus, players consistently provide free labour in the game of data collection for Niantic.<br><br>
                By having players more engaged and their behaviour monitored along with constant location tracking, Pokemon Go can profit by selling this data to third parties. ‘The more egregious example is the company sells images or videos from users' phones that could include other personal information.’ (Thongmak, 2022). All of this data is used by commercial businesses to plan ways to get more foot traffic such as incentivising players with in-game tasks to visit an area. It can also develop to partnerships with businesses such as Mcdonalds or Starbucks to become a Pokestop Location and profit off this gamification, with the Pokestop locations designed to lead players to certain areas.
